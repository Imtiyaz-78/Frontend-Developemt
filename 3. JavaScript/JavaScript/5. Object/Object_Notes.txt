    In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.

    In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

    Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Dates are always objects
    Maths are always objects
    Regular expressions are always objects
    Arrays are always objects
    Functions are always objects
    Objects are always objects
    All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.



    A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

    JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

    Examples
    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined
    symbol
    bigint


    ----> Object Properties
    The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.

    Property	Value
    firstName	John
    lastName	Doe
    age	50
    eyeColor	blue

    -----> It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
