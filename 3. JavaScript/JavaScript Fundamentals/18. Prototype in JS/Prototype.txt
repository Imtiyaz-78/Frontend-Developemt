==> What is Prototype:
    JavaScript have a special property called prototype that is either null or references another obj
  
    Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit the features from one another.

    JavaScript is a prototype based language, so, whenever we create a function using JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function,
   
    Prototype property is basically an object (also known as Prototype object), where we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.



===> Prototype: Additional kuchh hidden function or properties mil rahe hai jab print karte hai
                toh jab mai object ko print karta hu toh tab object itself kuchh properties deta
                hai and that this properties is called prototype.
