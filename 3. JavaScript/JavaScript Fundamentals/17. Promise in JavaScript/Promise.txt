1. Promise:
    1. The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) 
       of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
    
   2. It is based on a resolution which may be resolved as a success or failure.
   3. A promise returns a fulfilled state with a value. 
  

==> A Promise is in one of these states:
        1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        2. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
        3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
