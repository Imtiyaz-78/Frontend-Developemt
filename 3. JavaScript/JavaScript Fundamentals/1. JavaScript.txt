<====================> JavaScript-fundamentals <=========================>

=> Variables:
   Variables are container to store the data

=> Variable Rules:
   1. Variable name are case sensitives; "a" & "A" is diffrent.
   2. Only letters, digits, underscore(_), and $ is allowed (not even space).
   3. Only a letter, underscore(_), Or $ should be 1st character.
   4. Reserved words cannot be Variable names.

   Ex: fullName  <--- camel case (This is best and mostly use)
       full_name <--- snake case 
       full-name <--- kabab case
       FullName  <--- pascal case 


==> let, var & const
    1. var: Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope
    2. let: Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope Variable
    3. const: Variable cannot be re-declared or not be upadted. A block scope Variable


==> How memory work in JavaScript:
   -> There are two type of memory in JavaScript
   1. Stake memory (All Primitives type data are use Stack memory)
   2. Heap memory (All Non-Primitives type data are use heap memory)

 == > Array is JavaScript:
      Array is object in JavaScript.
      Array are contain mix of diffrent data-Types, Ex: [10, 20, "Apple", true, 50].
      Array in Js Resizable that means we can more after after declared.
      JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies.
        
         --> shallow copies:
             A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. 


        --> deep copy:
            A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made.

         --> shallow copy ka matlb hota hai if hum uske reference copy ko chnage karenge then
             uske original copy mein change hoga.
