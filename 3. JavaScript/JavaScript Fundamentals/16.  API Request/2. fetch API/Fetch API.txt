// fecth API:
   1. The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).
   2. For making a request and fetching a resource, use the fetch() method.
   3. It is a global method in both Window and Worker contexts.
   4. The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network,
      returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available 




--->>Note--> The Fetch API uses Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests),
             as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.
 
--->> The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource.

===> How to use the Fetch API:
    The Fetch API is provided as a high-level function, and in its most basic version, 
    it takes a URL and produces a promise that resolves to the response:


fetch("http://example.com/api/endpoint")
  .then((response) => {
    // Do something with response
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log("Unable to fetch -", err);
  });

     full toh nhi hai and meri call stack khali toh nhi hai
