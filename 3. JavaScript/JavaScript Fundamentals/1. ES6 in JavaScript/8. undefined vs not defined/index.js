// undefined vs not defined in javascript:
// In JavaScript, "undefined" and "not defined" are two different things.  
// The variable is declared but its value is set to 'undefined'. On the other hand,  
// "not defined" means that the variable has not been declared at all. 


console.log(a);
if (a === undefined) {
    console.log("undefined");
} else {
    console.log("undefined");
}
var a = "Imtiyaz";           // Defined with a value ("Imtiyaz")
console.log(a);

console.log(b); // Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
// This will throw an error because 'b' has not been declared yet.



// --> b is not defined:
/* b is not defined ka matlab ye hai ki b ko memory ke under jagah or space hi nhi mili hai*/
