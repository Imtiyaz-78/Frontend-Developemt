==> Memorization in Javascript:
    Memorization is an optimization technique that can be used to reduce
    time-consuming calculations by saving previous input to something called
    cache and returning the result form it.

    Memorization is an optimization is a technique that allows us to store 
    the results of expensive function calls and retrieve them when the same 
    inputs occur again. This significantly speeds up programs by avoiding  
    redundant computations.
