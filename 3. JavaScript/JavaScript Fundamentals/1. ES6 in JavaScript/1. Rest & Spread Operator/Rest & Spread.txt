same as a tis Rest and Spread operator are behave two different ways.


--> Rest & Spread operator are mostly use in array and object.


---> Rest Operator:
     The rest operator a takes leftover pieces and puts them in an array or object.
     Syntax : ...restValue <--- restValue is the variable name where we want to put our leftovers.
